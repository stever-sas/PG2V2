*  1) Highlight the PROC CONTENTS step and run the        *;
*     selected code. What is the type of High, Low, and   *;
*     Volume?                                             *;
*  2) Highlight the DATA and PROC PRINT steps and run the *;
*     selected code. Notice that although High is a       *;
*     character column, the Range column is accurately    *;
*     calculated.                                         *;
*  3) Open the log. Read the note printed immediately     *;
